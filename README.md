## DraculaBot
This bot is used on the official Vampirism Server Discord to add administrative features, various commands and automations.

The purpose of this repository is not to provide other people with a perfect bot that can be adapted to their needs with just a few clicks. Many things are hardcoded, explicitly adapted to our server, or probably inefficient - if not even worse: not best practice - because: it's not stupid if it works. And it does.
